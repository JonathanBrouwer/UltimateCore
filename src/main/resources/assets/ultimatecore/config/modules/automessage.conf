  # If you want to make a second automessage instance, copy-pase everything between the "COPY-PASTE START" and the "COPY-PASTE END" and paste it under this comment
  # This will make a completely indendent instance, which means you can for example have one task send a message every two minutes,
  # While another task sends a message every three minutes, and they won't interfere in any way.
